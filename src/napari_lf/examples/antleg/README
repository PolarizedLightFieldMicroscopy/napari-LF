This is a light field of an ant leg, taken using a water immersion 20x
0.5NA objective and a 125um pitch, f/20 microlens array (focal length
2433um).  The image was collected on an Andor Neo sCMOS imager (6.5um 
pixel pitch).  The image was magnified slightly using a 50:35 relay lens 
that makes for an effective pixel size of 4.55um.

This directory also contains a radiometry image collected by placing a
fluorescent flat field test slide under the microscope.  This serves
to calibrate both the radiometry and position of the lenslets.

The dark frame was taken with no light falling on the sensor.
This gives the bias level for the camera, which is taken into
account when reconstructing the image.
